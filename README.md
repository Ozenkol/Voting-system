# 🗳️ National E-Voting System Design

---

## ✅ 1. Functional & Non-Functional Requirements

### 🔧 Functional Requirements
- Secure voter authentication using national ID or biometrics.
- Anonymous voting — identity decoupled from vote.
- Each voter can submit only one vote.
- Immutable vote storage and public auditability.
- Accessible via personal devices and government kiosks.
- Admin panel for certification and result auditing.

### 🧪 Non-Functional Requirements

| Category          | Requirement                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scalability**   | Nationwide scale; millions of concurrent users                              |
| **QPS (Peak)**    | 50K–200K during peak hours                                                  |
| **P99 Latency**   | < 300ms for vote submission and confirmation                               |
| **Anonymity**     | Voter identity completely decoupled post-authentication                    |
| **Consistency**   | Strong consistency for vote writes (via blockchain consensus)              |
| **Availability**  | 99.999% uptime; 2-week voting period allows for time-based failover        |
| **Resilience**    | Withstands geopolitical and datacenter-level failures                     |
| **Security**      | End-to-end encryption, HSMs, secure boot, anti-DDoS                        |
| **Fault Tolerance** | Supports vote queuing and delayed sync during network partitions         |
| **Auditability**  | Public Merkle tree or blockchain-based proof of vote history               |

## ⚖️ 2. Tradeoffs

| Feature                               | Tradeoff                                                               |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Blockchain for immutability          | Increased storage, complexity, and potential latency                   |
| Regional government datacenters      | More complex synchronization logic                                     |
| Anonymous tokens (blind signatures)  | Cryptographic complexity, session/state management overhead            |
| Full auditability                    | Extra resource usage for cryptographic proofs and publishing           |
| 2-week voting duration               | Defends against surge traffic but requires long-term reliability       |

## 📦 3. API Specification (Draft)

### 🔐 `/auth/login`
- `POST`: Accepts credentials → returns auth token

### 🎟 `/token/issue`
- `POST`: Issues a blind-signed voting token (anonymous)

### 🗳️ `/vote/submit`
- `POST`: Accepts signed vote payload with token

### 📜 `/audit/proof`
- `GET`: Returns Merkle proof or blockchain hash for submitted vote

### 📈 `/admin/dashboard`
- `GET`: Admin view of vote stats and blockchain status

---

## 🧱 4. Data Model & Analytics

### 🗄️ Data Models
- `Voter`: `{ voter_id, region, auth_method }` (transient, not linked to vote)
- `Vote`: `{ token_id, vote_content, timestamp, hash }`
- `AuditBlock`: `{ block_hash, vote_hashes[], timestamp }`

### 📊 Analytics
- Vote turnout by region
- Vote method: mobile vs kiosk
- Token issuance vs vote submission success
- Fraudulent token rate and invalid attempts

## ⚠️ 5. Failure Handling, Degradation, and Monitoring

| Component         | Failure Mode                   | Strategy                                                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Auth API         | Unreachable                     | Fallback to federated backup auth provider                |
| Kiosk            | Power/network failure           | Report to backup, user notified to retry on another kiosk |
| Blockchain Node  | Consensus delays                | Vote queuing and retry on separate consensus group        |
| Token Service    | Token exhaustion or DoS         | Rate-limit per IP, cache token availability               |

### Monitoring Stack
- **Prometheus + Grafana**: Latency, token issuance, vote writes
- **AlertManager**: Notify on abnormal patterns
- **Logs**: Auth failures, voting latency, blockchain commit logs

## 🛠️ 6. System Complexity & Maintenance

### 🔍 Complexity Considerations
- Cryptography and secure token generation
- Kiosk hardware security + physical access risks
- Time synchronization for regional clocks

### 🧹 Maintenance & Decommissioning
- Rotate cryptographic keys post-election
- Archive and sign blockchain for historical record
- Secure wipe of temporary kiosk and backend storage

### 💰 Cost Considerations
- Hosting (cloud/hybrid with regional data centers)
- Hardware procurement for kiosks
- Blockchain validator node management
- Penetration testing, audits, and bug bounties

## 🖼️ 7. System Diagrams (Suggested)

1. **Component Diagram** — Auth, Token Service, Voting Service, Ledger, Audit Publisher
2. **Sequence Diagram** — Voter → Auth → Token → Vote Submit → Blockchain Write → Audit
3. **Network Diagram** — Voter → Edge Gateway → Regional Services
4. **Data Separation Diagram** — Auth Flow vs Vote Flow

## 🔄 8. Graceful Degradation & Reliability

- All services stateless, backed by durable queues
- Read-only dashboards during write outages
- Vote buffering and deferred submission during failures
- Secure retry mechanisms for token reissue
- Periodic snapshots of blockchain state

## ♾️ 9. Final Notes & Continuous Improvement

- Explore use of zk-SNARKs for zero-knowledge proofs
- Simulate network partitions and Byzantine behavior
- Periodic load testing under voting week conditions
- Enhance kiosk accessibility for visually impaired users
- Design citizen feedback mechanism post-election
