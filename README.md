# 🗳️ National E-Voting System Design

---

## ✅ 1. Functional & Non-Functional Requirements

### 🔧 Functional Requirements
- Secure voter authentication using national ID or biometrics.
- Anonymous voting — identity decoupled from vote.
- One vote per eligible voter.
- Immutable vote storage with public audit logs.
- Access via personal devices and secure kiosks.
- Admin dashboards for real-time tracking and auditing.

### 🧪 Non-Functional Requirements

| Category           | Requirement                                                             |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scalability**    | Must support millions of voters concurrently                            |
| **Availability**   | 99.999% uptime during the 2-week election period                        |
| **Latency**        | P99 < 300ms for vote submission                                         |
| **Consistency**    | Strong consistency for vote ledger writes                               |
| **Anonymity**      | Complete decoupling of voter ID and vote content                        |
| **Fault Tolerance**| Multi-datacenter with vote buffering during outages                     |
| **Security**       | Encryption, secure hardware modules (HSM), intrusion detection systems  |
| **Auditability**   | Public ledger of vote hashes (Merkle Tree / Blockchain)                 |

## ⚖️ 2. Tradeoffs

| Feature                          | Tradeoff                                                             |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Regional datacenters             | Improves latency, adds synchronization complexity                    |
| Blind signatures for anonymity   | Increased cryptographic complexity and performance cost              |
| Immutable blockchain ledger      | Storage and consensus overhead                                      |
| Public kiosk voting              | Physical maintenance and security challenges                         |
| Two-week voting window           | Simplifies load handling but increases operational uptime demands    |

## 🧰 8. Monitoring, Degradation & Fault Handling

### 🔔 Monitoring & Alerting

| Tool             | Metric/Alert                                      |

- Byzantine fault tolerance across regional ledgers
- Multi-device vote casting + synchronization
- Secure kiosk management and OS hardening

### 🧹 Maintenance

- Key rotation policy post-election
- Blockchain archiving and validation
- Secure deletion of temporary caches
- Regular updates of kiosk firmware

### 💰 Cost Considerations

- Redundant infrastructure for every region
- Kiosk purchase and upkeep
